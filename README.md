# Pong Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard. Players can control their paddles using the keyboard and compete to score points.

## Features

- Two paddles: One controlled by the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys for the right paddle and "W" and "S" keys for the left paddle.
- Ball movement with bouncing mechanics.
- Scoreboard that updates each time a player misses the ball.
- Game ends when the user closes the window.
